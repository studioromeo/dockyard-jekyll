<h2>Dockyard is a Jekyll site built for documentation.</h2>
<p>It's designed to have a simple and intuative user interface that gets to the point.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To install either copy the source files to a <a href="http://pages.github.com/">new github pages repository</a> or a jekyll powered server. Bingo, that's Dockyard installed!<p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>All your documentation is written in markdown files which reside in the <strong>_posts</strong> directory.</p>
<p>To create a new article, create a new file with the format <strong>YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md</strong> inside the <strong>_posts directory</strong></p>

<h3>That's not all</h3>
<p>This was designed to be a running project. If there's something you'd like me to add feel free to open an issue.<p>
<p>Cheerio!</p>
