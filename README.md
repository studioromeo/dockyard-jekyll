Dockyard for Jekyll
======

##Dockyard is a Jekyll site built for documentation.
It's designed to have a simple and intuative user interface that gets to the point.

Installation
------------
To install either copy the source files to a [new github pages repository](http://pages.github.com/) or a jekyll powered server. Bingo, that's Dockyard installed!

Usage
-----
All your documentation is written in markdown files which reside in the **_posts** directory.
To create a new article, create a new file with the format **YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md** inside the **_posts directory**

That's not all
This was designed to be a running project. If there's something you'd like me to add feel free to open an issue
Cheerio!
